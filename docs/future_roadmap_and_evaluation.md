# Deep Evaluation & Future Roadmap (v1.6)
*Last updated: 2026-03-01 — reflects v1.6 90-fold walk-forward run (2007–2026)*

## 1. Deep Evaluation of Current Performance

### Overall Metrics (Full 90-Fold Run: 2007–2026)
*   **Mean Rank Accuracy**: **57.5%** (Baseline: 50%)
    *   Statistically robust over 19 years of OOS data including GFC and COVID-19. All 90 folds beat random chance.
*   **Mean Val Loss**: **0.461**
*   **Mean Magnitude MAE**: **0.35** — stable across all 90 folds.
*   **L/S Alpha**: Positive in **90/90 folds**, mean annualized alpha of **+31.57%**.
*   **NaN Training Folds**: **0/90 (100% stable)** — clipping and zero-padding fixes successfully eliminated all NaN states.
*   **ECE (raw)**: 0.015 — near-perfect confidence calibration.
*   **Conformal Coverage**: 89.4% (target ≥ 90% for α=0.10).

### Regime Analysis (v1.6 Classification)
| Regime | Folds | Rank Accuracy | L/S Alpha | Validation Loss | Magnitude MAE |
| :--- | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| **Normal** | 54 | 57.44% | +33.64% | 0.4616 | 0.3484 |
| **Crisis** | 12 | 56.88% | +32.46% | 0.4683 | 0.3584 |
| **Calm** | 24 | 57.98% | +26.46% | 0.4569 | 0.3535 |

### Generalization Gap
*   **Conclusion**: Model demonstrates highly stable and profitable edge across all realized volatility states. The `Masked Superset Architecture` and dynamic `EarlyStopping` prevent overfitting even in massive drawdowns (Crisis).

## 3. Current Limitations

### A. Execution & Costs (Not Modeled)
The backtest does not model slippage or commissions.
*   **Risk**: High-turnover daily rebalancing at 57.5% accuracy could be deeply impacted by fees.
*   **Fix**: Integrate a 5 bps/trade cost model (TCA) and evaluate using the top 10/bottom 10 sector portfolios instead of full deciles to reduce turnover.

### B. Temperature Scaling Counter-Productive
The model's raw ECE (0.015) is already excellent. Temperature scaling with T=1.50 actually *increases* ECE to 0.029. This is expected — the v1.6 training fixes resolved the overconfidence issue at its root. Temperature calibration should only be applied if future model changes degrade raw calibration.

## 4. Future Roadmap

### Phase 0: Remaining Deployment Items
1.  **Benchmark vs simple models** (Rec 11) — compare against momentum, sector rotation, and random baselines.
2.  **Transaction Cost Analysis** — 5 bps/trade cost model integration.
3.  **Full re-run with recalibrated thresholds** — validate regime-adaptive features with corrected boundaries.

### Phase 1: Portfolio Construction (Short-Term)
1.  **Mean-Variance Optimizer** — feed `dir_logits` + `mag_preds` into a convex optimizer.
2.  **Risk Parity via graph clusters** — equal-risk allocation across learned stock clusters.
3.  **Conformal abstention gating** — skip trades where `set_size = 2` or `set_size = 0`.

### Phase 2: Alpha Expansion (Medium-Term)
1.  **Alternative data** — news/sentiment as new heterogeneous graph node type.
2.  **RL fine-tuning (PPO)** — optimize directly for Sharpe Ratio post-supervised-pretraining.
3.  **Multi-horizon targets** — simultaneous 1d, 5d, 20d prediction heads.
